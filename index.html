    <h2>Skills</h2>
    Mastery of informatics tools and computer usage, in particulare the Office Suite, Web navigating, audio and graphics software.
    <br>
    <br>
    Good knowledge of the practices and tools used in the stages of music pre-production, production and post-production. More than good knowledge of numerous software and hardware for music production and programming (Cubase, Pro Tools, Ableton Live, Melodyne; N.I. Maschine; D.S. Prophet 12; other). Good knowledge of the principles and techniques of sound synthesis. Good knowledge of the MIDI protocol. Ten-year experience in composing electronic music, original songs and remixes. In 2009 I self-produced an album, dealing autonomously with composition and arrangements, sampling, programming, sound design, voice and instrument recording. I have a good background in music theory and have studied piano privately. As a studio assistant I was able to relate to a large number of professional musicians and to actively participate in the various stages of musical creation, providing logistical/technical support and making my knowledge available.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks to the autonomous activity of holiday homes manager, I have developed excellent relationship skills with tourists, dealing with communication (often in english), reception, hospitality. I also dealt with the management of the websites for the publication of the apartments (Air Bnb, Booking, Vrbo).
    <br>
    <br>
    The activity of commercial adviser led me to relate daily with the most diverse types of people. This requires me to take great care of appearance and language, learn to get in tune with customers, know how to present and sell the products and devices handled by the company.
    <br>
    <br>
    Independent experiences of gardening, cultivation and care of plants, annual harvest of olives and carobs.
